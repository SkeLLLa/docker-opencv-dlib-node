Based on [opencv-dlib image](https://hub.docker.com/r/m03geek/opencv-dlib/)

# Versions (latest)

* node - 10.3.0
* dlib - 19.8
* opencv - 3.4.1

# Notes

If you want to use some native modules you'll need to install at least `python`.

So you can add following lines to your dockerfile.

## Alpine 

For alpine you will also need `libstdc++` for building native modules.

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --virtual .build-deps python libstdc++ gcc g++
```

Also you may need `libc6-compat` if your native modules will use glibc.

After bould you may want ot delete build deps in order to reduce image size.

```Dockerfile
RUN apk del .build-deps
```

> Remember: you'll need to delete them in one layer with adding them or use `--squash` to reduce actual size.

## Stretch (debian)

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python build-essential
```

# Node.js lib compatibility

* [opencv4nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencv4nodejs) - native module, see installing instructions above and follow module documentation.
* [face-recognition](https://www.npmjs.com/package/face-recognition) - native module, see installing instructions above and follow module documentation.

## Installing opencv4nodejs

```Dockerfile
FROM m03geek/opencv-dlib-node:alpine
RUN apk update && apk add -u --no-cache python make g++
RUN npm i opencv4nodejs
```

## Installing face-recognition

```Dockerfile
FROM m03geek/opencv-dlib-node:alpine
RUN apk update && apk add -u python make g++ libpng-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev giflib-dev libx11-dev
RUN npm init -y
RUN npm i face-recognition
```
